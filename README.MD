# Mobility

Mobile application for a convenience store which handles the reception of products by using a phone with a barcode scanner attached.

The mobile app is used for:
- reception of products from a supplier
- checking prices of products inside the store.

The Python3 script which runs on the store server is used for:
- hosting a simple HTTP server to respond to GET/POST requests from the mobile app
- communicating with the local Firebird database.
